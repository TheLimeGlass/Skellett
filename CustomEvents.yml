# Skellett the addon with the beast name!
# By LimeGlass

#Custom events! I'm proud to release CustomEvents in Skellett. It's not like functions from Skript or custom events from MundoSk.
#This is Skellett Custom Events! Here you can make ANY event you possiblly want!
#You can grab and make ANY event that Spigot or any of your plugins contain.
#Before I get into explaining it, I just want to say watch your syntax. If any syntax matches or overrides another syntax. Skript will throw an error.
#Either that other addon's event will break or skript will break the event of both Skellett and that other addon.

#Ok now getting into the tutorial section. Which isn't too complex.
#The number of events must be set to anything higher than 0. It can't be 0 itself.
#The event location has to be the EXACT location of your event, or else Skellett won't find the event.
#The syntax is where the portion you use in your script. The first example below would be:
#
#On hanging entity:
#    Broadcast "%event-entity%"
#
#Keep in mind that skript will only automatically pickup event types such as: cancel the event, event-entity, event-string, event-player or event-location etc. If available.
#I might make custom expressions later but for right now, you can enjoy events.
#
#Again I can't stress this enough. If an event is already registered or your syntax matches another. The chances of it breaking are very high. So just be careful when doing so.
#
#You can enable or disable your custom events here
CustomEvents: false
# Unleash the power, and stride onwards!
